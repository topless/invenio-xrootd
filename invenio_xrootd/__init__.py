r"""XRootD file storage support for Invenio.

This modules provide an Invenio file storage interface for XRootD. By default
Invenio already has support for XRootD via
`PyFilesytem <http://docs.pyfilesystem.org/en/latest/>`_  and the
`XRootDPyFS <http://pythonhosted.org/xrootdpyfs/>`_ package. This module
adds optimization and performance improvements such as efficient checksum
calculations.

Using this module is as simple as configuring your Invenio instance to
use the storage factory:

.. code-block:: python

   # config.py
   FILES_REST_STORAGE_FACTORY = \
       'invenio_xrootd:xrootd_storage_factory'

The module also provides a file storage interface for CERN EOS disk storage
system via XRootD protocol.

Using the EOS file storage module is as easy as configuring:

.. code-block:: python

   # config.py
   FILES_REST_STORAGE_FACTORY = \
       'invenio_xrootd:eos_storage_factory'

Overwriting reported checksum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XRootD v3.x only has support for reporting adler32 as the used checksum
algorithm, even though the server might be providing e.g. an MD5 checksum. If
this is the case, you can overwrite the reported checksum using the
configuration variable ``XROOTD_CHECKSUM_ALGO``:

.. code-block:: python

   # config.py
   XROOTD_CHECKSUM_ALGO = 'md5'

Keberos authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your XRootD server requires Keberos authentication (e.g. CERN EOS), then you
can run a tool such as
`k5start <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/kstart/k5start.html>`_ on each
client node in order to obtain a keberos ticket and continue keeping the ticket
valid. The XRootD python bindings will transparently use this keberos ticket
to authenticate against your server.
